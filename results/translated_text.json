"Once upon a time, a little rabbit lived in the forest. His name was Miko. Miko was very curious and wanted to explore different corners of the forest every day. One day he found a cat sleeping under a tree. The cat was very sweet, but Miko didn't approach him because he didn't want to disturb his sleep. The next day, Miko said to him, \"Hello!\" The cat smiled: \"Hi, I'm Luna, isn't there something beautiful here?\""
